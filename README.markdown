# What is this?
These are Jim Lawton's shell configuration dotfiles. The primary goal is to increase CLI productivity on Linux (mainly Ubuntu), though many scripts run just fine on any POSIX implementation.

# Focus
The focus is on Bash support.

# Inspirations
The contents of this repo are based on Matthew McCullough's original (https://github.com/matthewmccullough/dotfiles). Others have been created over the years and gathered here.
